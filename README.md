# Fe-Fluorides-Topopchemical

This repository contains the density functional theory (DFT) calculated data associated with our research paper, "Topochemical Modulations from 1D Iron Fluoride Precursor to 3D Frameworks" that is published in Inorganic Chemistry and can be found at this <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/papers/ghosh-ic/#:~:text=10.1021/acs.inorgchem.4c00425">DoI</a>. The manuscript is a collaborative effort between the research groups of <a href="https://energystoragejncasr.wixsite.com/energylab/group">Prof. Premkumar Senguttuvan</a>, <a href="https://clement.materials.ucsb.edu/">Prof. Raphaële J. Clément</a>, and the sai-mat group.

The objective of the work was to understand the topochemical relationships and mechanisms involved in synthesizing iron-based fluorides containing sodium, potassium, and ammonium intercalant ions. The various folders in this repository contain the final DFT relaxed structures and output files, along with a few useful python scripts.

In case you use any of the data here, we would appreciate a citation to our manuscript at this <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/papers/ghosh-ic/#:~:text=10.1021/acs.inorgchem.4c00425">DoI</a>.
